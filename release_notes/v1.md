## [v1.0.0](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

November 21, 2019

The mdn-browser-compat-data 1.0.0 release is a non-breaking release! It is the 100th release of fresh compat data brought to you by the MDN team at Mozilla.

From now on: we're guaranteeing data structure stability and any changes to how the data is exposed will be communicated using minor and major version bumps. Compatibility data will still be continuously updated on a weekly basis and the patch version will be used if data-only updates happened. So, you can expect a 1.0.1 release next week.
