# @mdn/browser-compat-data release notes (v0.x)

## [v0.0.99](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/releases/tag/v0.0.99)

November 14, 2019

### Notable changes

**Next week (on 21st November 2019), we will release version 1.0.0 (instead of 0.0.100). Please make sure your package.json semver query takes this into account! (see also npm semver calculator at https://semver.npmjs.com/)**

There are no breaking changes in 1.0.0. It is just that we should finally use semver correctly and call it a 1.0.0 :)
